_NumPy_ is the fundamental package for array computing with Python.
* NumPy is a linear algebra library for python, the reason it is important for data science with python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.
* NumPy is also incredibly fast, as it has buildings to C libraries.
* NumPy arrays essentially come in two flavors: vectors and matrices
* Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are 2-d.
